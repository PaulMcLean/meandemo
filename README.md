# One MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node.js) CRUD on Docker Demo App <a href="https://travis-ci.com/paulmcleanus/meandemo"><img src="https://api.travis-ci.com/paulmcleanus/meandemo.svg?branch=master"></a>
The project contained in this repository provides a basic working CRUD application built on Docker to get you up and coding on a MEAN stack in Docker, sooner.

In order to share a baseline understanding of containerization technologies built on Docker along with the practical knowledge necessary to begin building, shipping and deploying MEAN (Mongo / Express / Angular / Node.js) applications in containers, this project has been developed and made available through our public repo.

This project contains all content from "One MEAN CI/CD Docker Demo" presented at the Docker Government Summit in Tysons Corner VA on May 29, 2019.

### Prerequisites
- Internet Connection
- Running Docker Engine

### To run this project
* 1 - Download the repo (on Linux, be certain to also install docker-compose)
* 2 - From the project directory, "docker-compose up"

### Docker Hub paulmcleanus/public repo pull commands for project images
Pulling from the Hub is optional for those who just want to run (this meets the "SHIP" requirement)
* `docker push paulmcleanus/meandemo:nginx_angular_node`
* `docker push paulmcleanus/meandemo:express_node`
* `docker push paulmcleanus/meandemo:mongo`

### Docker Hub Integration added 4/22/19
All automatic image builds are stored in the Docker Hub paulmcleanus/public registry
* `docker pull paulmcleanus/meandemo:mongo`
* `docker pull paulmcleanus/meandemo:express_node`
* `docker pull paulmcleanus/meandemo:nginx_angular_node`


### Running e2e tests using selenium in Docker
We are using an additional docker container that runs the browser for selenium tests that is not part of the regular compose setup, we can specify a 2nd compose file to be used in addition in our command to run these tests as the selenium container is only used for tests and it not necessary for regular operation
* `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-e2e.yml run tester npm run e2e`
If you want to run in dev mode where you can edit locally without having to rebuild, you can run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up` and connect to the express_node container and you can run `npm e2e` as you are editing code. In this mode you can use VNC to see the test in action

### Running Angular Karma tests in Docker
Angular unit tests require a browser (Chrome in this case). Instead of installing this on the actual express server, we're using an existing Docker image to run these tests against our codebase from the express container. First build the tester container with `docker build -t tester  -f meandemo/TestDockerfile meandemo` then run `docker run tester npm run testheadless`
